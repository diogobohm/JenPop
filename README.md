JenPop
======

JenPop (if you didn’t guess, J is for Java, Gen is for genetic, Pop is for population) aims to provide a fast and easy way to create genetic populations, to find "good enough" solutions to many difficult and CPU intensive problems.

At the moment, only 2 features are available:

* Create generations and children (of any object) based on the rules you provide, from a parent class extending GeneticNode;</li>
* Get node scores and best nodes based on the rules you provide;</li>

And as a bonus, a sample of Tic Tac Toe implementing the above features, that will never lose. Can’t lose even when playing against itself. The code is standard Java, docs are on the way. It's not complex for now and the example explains it's use.

Happy coding!
